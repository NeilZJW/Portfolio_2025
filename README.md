# Portfolio_2025
Collecting recent works for educational purposes



# 📁 1. AIBarbeershop
This folder contains a small set of sample code from my undergraduate thesis, where I worked with the Barbershop (II2S embedding) method for face reconstruction and style blending based on StyleGAN.

The code here does not represent the full project, but only includes several selected parts that are suitable for sharing on GitHub.
## ✔ What I Worked On in My Thesis
Although the full project is not uploaded, my main contributions were:
- Speed optimization of the embedding process (approx. one-third faster in final version)
- Minor adjustments to parameter schedules for more stable results
- Refactoring selected parts of the original code into clearer functions

# 📁 2. Projects - Work & Experiments (Past Year)
This folder contains a collection of projects, experiments, and learning tasks I have worked on during the past year.
The contents span natural language processing, speech synthesis, statistical data analysis, IoT, and large language models.

The code here is a mixture of learning demos, ongoing experiments, and partial implementations, intended mainly for documenting my progress.

## 📌 1. BERT — Résumé Semantic Classification
A small project exploring the use of BERT for the semantic classification of job applicants' résumés.
- Fine-tuned BERT on custom categories
- Focused on extracting skill-based and experience-based patterns
- Demonstrates basic NLP pipeline building

## 📌 2. CosyVoice2 — Speech Synthesis (Ongoing)

Experiments based on the CosyVoice2 text-to-speech model.

Current goals:
- Running inference and comparing timbre consistency
- Building a simplified speech generation pipeline
- Future work: pronunciation assessment, aimed at helping language learners
This project is ongoing and will continue to expand.

## 📌 3. DataAnalysis_R — Statistics + ML in R
A study project focusing on combining traditional statistical methods and machine learning techniques for data analysis.

Includes:
- Implementations in R language
- Exploratory data analysis
- Regression, clustering, classical statistical testing
- Generation of various types of plots using ggplot2 and base

## 📌 4. FastText — Lightweight Semantic Classification
Small experiments with FastText for efficient text classification.
- Simple, fast semantic categorization
- Useful for comparison with BERT-based methods
- Good baseline for small datasets

## 📌 5. IoT_basic — Microcontroller Fundamentals
Learning projects related to IoT using C++ and microcontrollers.

Small demos such as:
- LED control
- Motor control
- Car lights and basic actuator control
- Sensor reading basics
This folder documents introductory embedded systems exercises.

## 📌 6. LLMs — Fine-tuning & Evaluation
This folder has two parts:

### (1) Simple Fine-Tuning Examples
- Focus on Qwen and DeepSeek models
- Basic demonstrations only (not full training pipelines)
- The actual project “Mind Companion” is under development and will be released later

### (2) Model Evaluation
- Using the OpenCompass framework
- Partial evaluation logs and scripts
- Experiments comparing different mainstream LLMs

# 📁 3. Teaching — Example Materials for Undergraduate Courses
This folder contains teaching examples and course materials that I prepared for international undergraduate students in fully English-medium classes.
Students came from diverse regions, including Africa, Russia, India, China, etc.

These materials aim to make complex AI concepts accessible and interactive for students from different academic backgrounds.

## 🎨 Computational Creativity (CC)
This section contains examples and teaching modules related to generative AI, creative algorithms, and the intersection between AI and art.
The content introduces fundamental AI concepts and gradually transitions into hands-on experiments using PyTorch, which is used as the main teaching framework.

Topics Covered Image Generation & Creativity Techniques, ncludes practical demonstrations of:
- DeepDream
- Neural Style Transfer (NST)
- Autoencoder / Variational Autoencoder (AE / VAE)
- Evolutionary / Genetic Algorithms in creative systems
- Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN)
- GAN variants (DCGAN, CycleGAN, cGAN, etc.)

## 🗣️ Natural Language Processing (NLP)
This section provides a structured introduction to classical and modern NLP techniques, starting from the fundamentals and progressing towards advanced neural architectures.
### ✔ Foundational Concepts: Tokenization, Bag-of-words & basic text statistics, N-gram language models, etc.
### ✔ Classical Neural Approaches: NNLM (Neural Network Language Model), Word embeddings (word2vec concepts), RNN-based models, Vanilla RNN, GRU, LSTM, etc.
### ✔ Modern Models: Introduction to Transformer architecture, Attention mechanism, etc.
