# 📁 1. AIBarbeershop
This folder contains a small set of sample code from my undergraduate thesis, where I worked with the Barbershop (II2S embedding) method for face reconstruction and style blending based on StyleGAN.

The code here does not represent the full project, but only includes several selected parts that are suitable for sharing on GitHub.
## ✔ What I Worked On in My Thesis
Although the full project is not uploaded, my main contributions were:
- Speed optimization of the embedding process (approx. one-third faster in final version)
- Minor adjustments to parameter schedules for more stable results
- Refactoring selected parts of the original code into clearer functions
